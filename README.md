# Days_of_Problem_Solving

Problem solving is a skill that requires not only at industries to develop projects and betterment of SDLC, but also effects our real life thinking. So my advise is to follow the solutions but never copy paste, it will do no good.

I was basically a theoretical computer engineer and gradually I realised that these knowledge will help me in education sector only.
